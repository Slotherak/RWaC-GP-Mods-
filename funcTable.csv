FuncName,FuncDescription,FuncArguments
connect,"connects through the given serial port to a peripheral. Types supported include keyboards, cameras, mice, CNC devices, and routers.","{connectionType=keyboard,mouse,printer,CNCextruder,CNCextractor,router} {serialPortNumber}"
deform,takes a primitive shape's vertice and moves it with optional subdivision,"{primObject} {verticePoint {must be on shape}} OR {verticeArray {must be on shape}} [subdivisionBoolean, defaults to 0 for no subdivision]"
flip,"reflects the whole object to produce a reversed object shape, as if seen in a mirror","{primObject} {axisType=xy,yz,xz,v} [if v, vectorOfPlaneNormal]"
help,Shows function usage and parameters,{funcName}
helpVector,"Vectors are an ambiguous term used a lot in math, physics, and engineering for a wide variety of purposes. All a vector really is, is a set of numbers, like:","{9, 4, -20} would be a vector that uses three values. This is common for position vectors, as it can represent X, Y, and Z coordinates. {6} is also a vector. It just has one value, but it is still a real vector."
helpVector2,"Directional vectors are often used on positional vectors for various reasons. It sounds complicated, but it actually makes it much easier. ","Another word you might be aware of is ""matrix"". That is a vector, of vectors {of vectors {of vectors {of vectors…} } }! This is the main reason we use vectors in this system."
helpVector3,"With matrix math, a lot of complicated questions can easily be computed and calculated. But all you need to know are what the vector holds, and how many of it it holds.","Normally, a vector holds numbers in each slot, separated by commas. Some use brackets [] some use parentheses { }, but you have to use parentheses with this system. Programming limits."
load,loads a file or program.,{filename} [fileDirectory]
move,shifts a shape or section of a shape by a vector transformation without any change in orientation,"{primObject} OR {verticeArray} OR {faceArray} {vectorDirection, format x, y, z, distance}"
new,"refreshes the viewport, resetting all shapes and primitives to factory settings",none
newShape,creates a new shape primitive with the requested faces and vertices,{verticeArray} [faceArray]
qs,quicksaves a project to it's last registered save position. Disabled by default as this can overwrite files unintentionally.,none
redo,repeats the last transformative action {CAUTION: USE SPARINGLY. CAN BEHAVE UNEXPECTEDLY IF PAIRED WITH ITSELF OR NEW} {affects same commands as undo},none
reflect,takes a given selection of a shape and mirrors it across a given plane {cardinal plane or vector normal},"{primObject} OR {verticeArray} OR {faceArray} {axisType={xy,xz,yz,v} } [if v, vectorOfPlaneNormal]"
rickRoll,Play a short melody.,none
rotate,turns the object or selection on a given cardinal axis or a vector from the origin,"{primObject} OR {verticeArray} OR {faceArray} {rotationAmount, in degrees clockwise} {axisType={x,y,z,xy,xz,yz,-xy,-xz,-yz,v} } [if v, axisOfRotation]"
save,saves the current project to a file,{filename} [fileDirectory]
scale,change the size ratio of the given shape by a scalar,{primObject} {scalarDouble}
slic3r,runs the Slic3r program on the given shape to make the G-codes for 3D Printing,{primObject} {saveFileName}
undo,"use to revert the last transformative command's effects {does not affect help, slic3r, load, save, qs, or connect, but does affect new and itself}",none
